## Features

- **Interactive Coding Exercises**: Multiple exercise types including copy, fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, and construct
- **Progressive Learning**: Start with conceptual understanding, then move to implementation
- **AI Safety Focus**: Every lesson connects technical concepts to AI safety implications


## Exercise Types

1. **Copy**: Users type the exact code shown
2. **Fill-in**: Complete code with blanks (`___`)
3. **Multiple Choice**: Select from options then type the complete line
4. **Construct**: Write code based on a description

## Future Enhancements

- Real Python execution using Pyodide
- User accounts and progress tracking
- Interactive visualizations
- Community discussions
- More interpretability experiments
